# Basic_C-Sharp_Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework
### Description
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects written in C#. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including basic math operations, data types, branching statements, loops, arrays, lists, inheritance, abstract methods, overriding methods, lambda expressions, and more. Each project focuses on a specific concept or technique and provides a practical example of how to use it in C#.

Two of the projects that you might find particularly interesting are 
<p><strong>studentDB</strong></p> and 
<p><strong>carInsurance</strong></p> 
The carInsurance project is an application that calculates car insurance quotes based on user input. It demonstrates how to use C# and the .NET Framework to create a practical and useful application. 
The studentDB project is an example of how to use Entity Framework Code First to create a simple student database. It shows how to define entity classes, create a context class, and perform basic CRUD operations on the data.

Overall, this repository provides a valuable resource for anyone learning C# or looking to improve their skills. By exploring the different projects and studying the code, you can gain a deeper understanding of the C# language and the .NET Framework. ðŸ˜Š
